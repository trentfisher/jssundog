	* js/util/imagemgr.js (get):
	supposedly cloning an element is faster than creating a new one
	try with get method... faster by about 15%, but image dimmensions
	are incorrect (0x0).

	* js/ui/interact.js: generic interaction window
	superset of ship bays, player window and any similar windows
	Major restructure.

2007-04-23  Trent Fisher  <trent@phaedrus.veganmilitia.org>

	* js/ui/win.js (function): that was freaky!
	I added code to update the ship's bays in case
	anything changed since it was last viewed (like inventory changes
	or blown components.

2007-04-21  Trent Fisher  <trent@phaedrus.veganmilitia.org>

	* js/ui/win.js (function): make the dropping of items work.
	trash can destroys it.
	inventory is transfered in the XML document

	* js/ui/zoomaction.js (ZoomAction): try to add a "veil" window
	right below the current one.  I was hoping it would intercept all
	underlying event handlers, but it doesn't seem to work that way.
	(ZoomAction): the problem was two-fold, I wasn't setting the
	z-index consistently, and the "veil" has to be absolutely
	positioned for z-index to work

2007-04-20  Trent Fisher  <trent@phaedrus.veganmilitia.org>

	* js/ui/win.js:  Implement the beginnings of drag and drop
	used a lightweight module I found on the web (after an attempt
	to implement it myself from scratch).
	Still need to make it reflect in the actual inventory (xml)

	* test/ex.html: Need to formalize exception handling... explore
	how the Error object works in FF and IE

2007-04-18  Trent Fisher  <trent@phaedrus.veganmilitia.org>

	* test/xpath.html:
	the text/textContent problem is that I need to descend down one
	more level to the "#text" node using firstChild
	then the "data" attribute works

2007-04-17  Trent Fisher  <trent@phaedrus.veganmilitia.org>

	* test/xpath.html:
	figured it out... kinda...
	If I do a load using the routine in the XML module, it works
	however, IE does not implement the standard "textContent"
	attribute, they use "text" instead.  Another wrapper function.

	* sundog.html: changed to strict xhtml
	Had to make a few minor changes as style dimmensions must always
	have a unit, so I had to append "px" in a few places (anywhere I
	was assigning into a stylesheet).

	* js/ui/win.js (shipBay): new routine to create ship bay
	popup.  need to figure out how to name these things in the xml

2007-04-16  Trent Fisher  <trent@phaedrus.veganmilitia.org>

	* test/xpath.html:
	doesn't work in IE 6.02900.2180.xpsp_sp2_gdr.161219-0316
	this line (in xml.js) causes an exception
	return context.selectSingleNode(this.xpathText);
	everything looks fine up until then.
	nope, it appears that context is blank due to the previous if
	doc.documentElement is null
	My patience for IE has run out.

2007-04-15  Trent Fisher  <trent@phaedrus.veganmilitia.org>

	* js/ui/win.js (function): 
	move window creation functions here
	add in XML use
	works on safari and firefox

	* dat/skin/default.xml: 
	change alt to title for mouseovers

	* js/util/xml.js: 
	the problem seems to be that the xpath wrapper does not follow w3c
	standards (because firefox is sloppy)
	http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/show.dml/429702
	fixed!

	* test/xpath.html: wrote a test case

2007-04-14  Trent Fisher  <trent@localhost.localdomain>

	* js/main.js (startGame): 
	/skin/ship/img[@id='pod']/@src
	fails in opera...
	WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

	* xml.js: from the o'reilly book
	throws an exception.
	firefox has XML defined as a function (which doesn't seem to do
	anything).
	experiment with xpath
	XML.getNode(conf["dat/skin/default.xml"], "/skin/ship/map[@name='pod']")
	XML.getNode(conf["dat/skin/default.xml"], "/skin/ship/map[@name='pod']/area[1]")
	XML.getNode(conf["dat/skin/default.xml"], "/skin/ship/map[@name='pod']/area[1]/@alt")
	that will be an easier way to deal with things.

	* js/main.js (loadGame): separate out the XML and img callbacks
	no crash!
	got an uncaught exception...
	The callback for an img gets a "load" object 
	the image is in currentTarget

	* js/util/httpreq.js (requestImage): crash happens during the
	callback... first callback

	* js/main.js: cool!  I just crashed Firefox!
	(loadGame): it is happening here when handling the XML
	opera is not happy... doh!  forgot to return false from onclick.
	now opera is happy.
	the requestImage() call seems to be the cause of the crash
	
	* ChangeLog: why wasn't I maintaining one of these before?
	look at SVN for exact changes
