	* test/xml.js: 
	the problem seems to be that the xpath wrapper does not follow w3c
	standards (because firefox is sloppy)
	http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/show.dml/429702
	fixed!

	* test/xpath.html: wrote a test case

2007-04-14  Trent Fisher  <trent@localhost.localdomain>

	* js/main.js (startGame): 
	/skin/ship/img[@id='pod']/@src
	fails in opera...
	WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

	* xml.js: from the o'reilly book
	throws an exception.
	firefox has XML defined as a function (which doesn't seem to do
	anything).
	experiment with xpath
	XML.getNode(conf["dat/skin/default.xml"], "/skin/ship/map[@name='pod']")
	XML.getNode(conf["dat/skin/default.xml"], "/skin/ship/map[@name='pod']/area[1]")
	XML.getNode(conf["dat/skin/default.xml"], "/skin/ship/map[@name='pod']/area[1]/@alt")
	that will be an easier way to deal with things.

	* js/main.js (loadGame): separate out the XML and img callbacks
	no crash!
	got an uncaught exception...
	The callback for an img gets a "load" object 
	the image is in currentTarget

	* js/util/httpreq.js (requestImage): crash happens during the
	callback... first callback

	* js/main.js: cool!  I just crashed Firefox!
	(loadGame): it is happening here when handling the XML
	opera is not happy... doh!  forgot to return false from onclick.
	now opera is happy.
	the requestImage() call seems to be the cause of the crash
	
	* ChangeLog: why wasn't I maintaining one of these before?
	look at SVN for exact changes
