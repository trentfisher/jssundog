This project is my attempt to re-create the mid 80's computer game Sundog in javascript.  This is just an experiment at this point, and a way for me to learn more javascript and find out how far I can push it.

Design Goals:
  * Implement the original game as faithfully as possible.
  * Portable: just Javascript, CSS and DOM; no browser extensions or plugins.
  * Place as much data as possible in XML configuration files
  * Permit alternate skins (e.g. Apple and Atari image sets)

If you want to help out, let me know.
